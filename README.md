# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## My updated portfolio website
This update was meant to add all projects that I have created throughout the bootcamp and be able to showcase them.
### New Features 
- Modals for each project
- buttons to go to repo or live site inside the modal
- nav bar is working so when you click on resume you get to see my resume! 
- Here is the link to the live site [Click Me!](https://arecio3.github.io/portfolio-website-homework/)
